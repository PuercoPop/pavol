1 A pulseaudio module 
----------------------

  pavol is a very simple [StumpWM] module to interact with pulseaudio.

  This module doesn't intent to substitute complex programs like
  pavucontrol but just allow a very primitive control over one sink.

2 Install 
----------

  For the possible methods to load pavol, two of them are listed
  below.

2.1 Quicklisp 
==============

   Make the directory accessible to Quicklisp. There are various ways
   to do it, so read [Quicklisp]'s page. As in <2012-05-22 Tue>, the
   easiest way is to create a directory under
   `~/quicklisp/local-projects', like
   `~/quicklisp/local-projects/pavol' and put pavol's files there.

   After making the directory accessible to Quicklisp, insert in your
   `.stumpwmrc' file:



  (ql:quicklisp "pavol")



  [Quicklisp]: http://www.quicklisp.org/

2.2 Loading 
============

   Insert in your `.stumpwmrc', changing `/path/to/pavol' appropriately:



  (load "/path/to/pavol/pavol.lisp")


3 Usage 
--------

  Five commands are defined:

  + pavol-vol+
  + pavol-vol-
  + pavol-toggle-mute
  + pavol-interactive
  + pavol-exit-interactive

  The first three commands are supposed to be used using multimedia
  keys. For this, you have to assign the appropriate keys in your
  `.stumpwmrc'. For example:



  (define-key stumpwm:*top-map* (stumpwm:kbd "XF86AudioRaiseVolume") "pavol-vol+")


  The fourth command can be used if you don't have or don't want to
  use the media keys. Once executed, you can use `j', `k' and `m' keys
  to control the volume and exit the interactive mode using `ESC',
  `RET' or `C-g'.

4 Limitations 
--------------

  As stated before, pavol is a *very* simple module to control a
  single sink.

  So, if you have more than one sink, it'll probably fail to control
  your volume, without any warning.

  PulseAudio is a complex system, but pavol will only let you do three
  things:

  + Increase volume
  + Decrease volume
  + Mute volume
    
  You'll also not be able to control individual applications. It's all
  or nothing.

* A pulseaudio module

  pavol is a very simple [[http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/][StumpWM]] module to interact with pulseaudio.

  This module doesn't intent to substitute complex programs like
  pavucontrol but just allow a very primitive control over one sink
  and applications.

* Install

  For the possible methods to load pavol, two of them are listed
  below.

** Quicklisp

   Make the directory accessible to Quicklisp. There are various ways
   to do it, so read [[http://www.quicklisp.org/][Quicklisp]]'s page. As in <2012-05-22 Tue>, the
   easiest way is to create a directory under
   `~/quicklisp/local-projects', like
   `~/quicklisp/local-projects/pavol' and put pavol's files there.

   After making the directory accessible to Quicklisp, insert in your
   `.stumpwmrc' file:

   #+begin_src lisp
     (ql:quicklisp "pavol")
   #+end_src

** Loading it directly

   Insert in your `.stumpwmrc', changing `/path/to/pavol' appropriately:

   #+begin_src lisp
     (load "/path/to/pavol/pavol.lisp")
   #+end_src

* Usage

  The following commands are defined:

  + pavol-vol+
  + pavol-vol-
  + pavol-toggle-mute
  + pavol-interactive
  + pavol-exit-interactive
  + pavol-application-list

  The first three commands are supposed to be used using multimedia
  keys. For this, you have to assign the appropriate keys in your
  `.stumpwmrc'. For example:

  #+begin_src lisp
    (define-key stumpwm:*top-map* (stumpwm:kbd "XF86AudioRaiseVolume") "pavol-vol+")
  #+end_src

  The `pavol-interactive' can be used if you don't have or don't want
  to use the media keys. Once executed, you can use `j', `k' and `m'
  keys to control the volume and exit the interactive mode using
  `ESC', `RET' or `C-g'.

  With `pavol-application-list' you can list the running applications
  that can have their volume controlled by pulseaudio. Navigate the
  menu using the `jk' keys and select the desired application using
  `RET'.

* Limitations

  As stated before, pavol is a *very* simple module to control a
  single sink.

  So, if you have more than one sink, it'll probably fail to control
  your volume, without any warning.

  PulseAudio is a complex system, but pavol will only let you do three
  things:

  + Increase volume
  + Decrease volume
  + Mute volume
